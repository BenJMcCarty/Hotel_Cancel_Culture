    "1. **Baseline Modeling**: \n",
    "   - Begin by developing baseline models using the full set of features identified during the EDA. This will provide an initial understanding of the model's performance and help identify which features contribute most to the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "   - After establishing the baseline, proceed with feature engineering to create new, potentially more predictive features. This includes deriving temporal features from date-related data and calculating occupancy statistics for each hotel.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dataset Expansion**:\n",
    "   - Expand the dataset as described earlier by creating daily records for each reservation. This will allow for the calculation of daily occupancy rates and other time-sensitive metrics that can be used as additional features in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Above and Beyond***\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the initial model performance, iteratively refine the feature set by removing features that are less likely to be known at the time of booking. This step will help align the model more closely with the real-world reservation process and improve its generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, the project will transition from EDA to more advanced modeling, enabling a deeper analysis of reservation patterns and ultimately leading to more accurate predictions of reservation outcomes.\n",
